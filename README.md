# Initial Setup

The repository initial structure was setup with the script localed in scripts/project_creation.sh

# Python Excercises

This repository contains the Python exercises for IaC module of PgDip in Computing in Cloud Technologies

## How to run a script

In order to run scripts in this repository and *if* the script does not have the bang shell at the beggining of it, please do python3 "script_file_name" in a Linux or Windows with python 3 installed or WSL. *If* the script has the bang shell at the beggining you can just run the script name, e.g. "./script_file_name" provided the OS can find the python executable.

These were tested in Ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.12.3

## Scripts Documentation Links

In this section, I link this readme to documentation links to of each script to keep this readme concise. I used pydoc with Sphinx style. HTML Generated PyDocs can be found in this repository in Documentation/HTMLPyDocs
